# Hey!
### Who I am
Hi! I'm a final-year PhD student in [Computational Statistics and Data Science](https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/students/mauro-camara-escudero/) at the Univerisity of Bristol where I focus on combining generative models (VAEs, GANs and Normalizing Flows) with scalable sampling methods (MCMC and SMC samplers) to perform likelihood-free inference in large and complex big data applications. One of my main applications is population genetics, but my methods can be applied in ecology, astronomy, economics, biology and physics.

### Where to find more information about me
