# Hi, I'm Mauro Camara Escudero
### Who I am
Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student in [Computational Statistics and Data Science](https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/students/mauro-camara-escudero/) at the Univerisity of Bristol where I focus on combining generative models (VAEs, GANs and Normalizing Flows) with scalable sampling methods (MCMC and SMC samplers) to perform likelihood-free inference in large and complex big data applications. One of my main applications is population genetics.

### Where to find more information about me
On my [website](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.app/) you can read:
- Machine Learning [posts](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.app/post/)
- A [list](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.app/industry/) of industry collaborations during my PhD such as providing a machine learning solution to LV and data science consultancy to EcoPowerSoft and Wessex Water.
- A very random [summary](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.app/books/) of some of the books I have read. I just keep it there so that when I want to remember something, I can search for it quickly.
