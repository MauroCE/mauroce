# Hey!
### Who I am
Hey! I'm a Research Associate in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Bristol, working with Christophe Andrieu. My research focuses on standard Bayesian inference, and generative models (VAEs, GANs, Normalizing Flows, Diffusion Models, Transformers). Before that, I was a PhD student in [Computational Statistics and Data Science](https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/students/mauro-camara-escudero/) and I worked on [Approximate Manifold Sampling](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.app/talk/bayescomp2023/) and [Integrator Snippets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13302), especially applied to likelihood-free inference and Bayesian inverse problems. I organize the [Generative Models Reading Group](https://github.com/MauroCE/GMRG). In my spare time, I also work as a ML contractor for a number of clients.
